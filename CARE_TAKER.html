        <h1>What Is Animal Care Taker?</h1> 
        <br>
        <p>
            Animal caretakers tend to the everyday needs of animals in a variety of settings, including kennels, clinics, and shelters. Animal caretakers may also be called animal attendants, animal keepers, or animal-care technicians. They feed and groom the animals, clean their cages, and examine the animals to make sure that they are well. They may also play with the animals, provide companionship, and observe behavior.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In kennels, shelters, or veterinary clinics, animal caretakers often assist in obedience training and breeding or administer vaccinations and other tests. In zoos and circuses they make sure animals are ready to be exhibited to the public. Animal caretakers often repair cages and fences, exercise the animals, and give information to the public about the animals.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            In all their tasks animal caretakers are usually supervised by a head keeper or trainer. In clinics they are supervised by a veterinarian. This supervisor is also in charge of training new caretakers.

         <h1>Education and Training Requirements</h1>
         <br>
         <p>
            A high school education is usually required to become an animal caretaker, and most of the training needed can be learned on the job. However, some zookeeping and animal training jobs may require a bachelor's degree. Interested individuals can gain experience working with animals by getting a job with a local veterinarian or by volunteering to work at a local animal shelter operated by the Humane Society or the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).

         <h1>What does an Animal Caretaker do?</h1>
         <br>
         <p>
            Animal caretakers train, feed, groom, and exercise animals. They also clean, disinfect, and repair the kennels and cages. They play with the animals, provide companionship, and observe behavioural changes that could indicate illness or injury.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            Boarding kennels, pet stores, animal shelters, veterinary hospitals, clinics, stables, laboratories, aquariums, and zoological parks all house animals and employ animal caretakers.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            Animal caretakers typically do the following:
         </p>
         <br>
         
         <ul>
            <li>
               Feed and give water to animals
            </li>
            <li>
               Clean equipment and the living spaces of animals
            </li>
            <li>
               Monitor animals and record information such as their diet, physical condition, and behaviour

            </li>
            <li>
               Examine animals for signs of illness or injury
            </li>
            <li>
               Exercise animals
            </li>
            <li>
               Bathe animals, trim nails, clip hair, and attend to other grooming needs 
            </li>
            <li>
               Train animals to obey and listen to commands
            </li>
        </ul>
         <br>
         <p>
            Non-farm animal caretakers typically work with cats and dogs in animal shelters. All caretakers look after the basic needs of animals, but more experienced ones may have more responsibilities, such as helping to vaccinate or euthanize animals under the direction of a veterinarian. Workers also may have administrative duties, such as keeping records on the animals, answering questions from the public, educating visitors about pet health, or screening people who want to adopt an animal.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            Some animal caretakers are groomers and care for the appearance and cleanliness of the animal. Some groomers are employed by kennels, veterinary clinics, or pet supply stores, where they groom mostly dogs and occasionally cats. In addition to cutting, trimming, and styling the pets fur, groomers clip nails, clean ears, and bathe pets. Some groomers also schedule appointments, sell products to pet owners, and identify problems that may require veterinary attention.

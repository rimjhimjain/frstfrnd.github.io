                    <li>
                        Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.

                <p>
                    Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.

                <h3>Grooming</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue
                </p>

                    Have you ever watched your dog roll on the ground, lick her coat or chew at her fur? These are her ways of keeping clean. Sometimes, though, she’ll need a little help from you to look and smell her best. But don’t worry, we’re here to help. Read on for ways to keep your dog’s fur, skin, nails, teeth, ears and paws healthy and clean.

                        <h4>Bathing Your Dog</h4>
                        <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="PIC_FOR_PROJECTS/bathing_dog_01.jpg" alt="pic" width="300px" height="300px">
                            <img src="PIC_FOR_PROJECTS/bathing_dog_02.jpg" alt="pic" width="300px" height="300px"> 
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                        The VCA recommends bathing your dog at least once every three months, but some may require more frequent baths if he or she spends a lot of time outdoors or has skin problems. Here are some steps to help you get started.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                First, give your pet a good brushing to remove all dead hair and mats, and then put him or her in a tub or sink that's been filled with about three to four inches of lukewarm water.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then, use a spray hose, large plastic pitcher or an unbreakable cup to completely wet your pet.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Take care to not spray or pour water directly in his ears, eyes or nose.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gently massage in shampoo, working from head to tail, and rinse and repeat as needed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dry him or her thoroughly by giving your pet a good rub with a large towel. Voila, clean pet!
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Dogs with loose facial skin or wrinkles—such as Shar Peis and Pugs—will need special attention. To prevent dirt and bacteria from causing irritation and infection, clean the folds with damp cotton. Always thoroughly dry the areas between the folds.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Bathing A Puppy</h5>
                        <p>
                            Some pups think that bath time is a perfect time to act goofy! Young puppies especially will wiggle and bounce all over the place, and tend to nip at bath time. If this sounds like your pet, put a floating toy in the tub with her so she can focus on that rather than on mouthing you.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Choosing a Shampoo</h5>
                        <p>
                            Using a shampoo formulated for pets is best. Human shampoos aren't toxic to pets, but some may contain fragrances or other substances that can irritate your pet's skin. Select a product that's specifically formulated for your species of animal, as some ingredients may be harmful when applied to different types of pets. It's always smart to talk with your pet's veterinarian to make sure you're selecting a shampoo that will meet your pet's needs.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Protecting Your Dog’s Eyes and Ears During Bath Time</h5>
                        <p>
                            Since shampoos and soaps can be major irritants, ask your vet for a sterile eye lubricant to use during bathing—this will help protect your pet's eyes from shampoo. You can also use a sprayer or a showerhead with a long hose, allowing you to control water flow during rinsing.  Avoid shampooing your pet's head altogether by simply using a wet washcloth to gently remove any dirt or debris from his or her face.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Protect your pet's ears, too, by placing a large cotton ball in each ear until the bath is over.
                        </p> 
                    </li>

                        <h4>Brushing Your Dog</h4>
                        <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="PIC_FOR_PROJECTS/brushing_dog_01.jpg" alt="pic" width="300px" height="300px">
                            <img src="PIC_FOR_PROJECTS/brushing_dog_02.jpg" alt="pic" width="300px" height="300px"> 
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            Regular grooming with a brush or comb will help keep your pet's hair in good condition by removing dirt, spreading natural oils throughout her coat, preventing tangles and keeping her skin clean and irritant-free. Plus, grooming time is a great time to check for fleas and flea dirt—those little black specks that indicate your pet is playing host to a flea family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The way you brush your pet—and how often—will largely depend on his or her coat type.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Smooth,Short Coats</h5>
                        <p>
                            If your dog has a smooth, short coat (like that of a Chihuahua, Boxer or Basset Hound), you only need to brush once a week. Use a rubber brush to loosen dead skin and dirt and follow with bristle brush to remove dead hair. Polish your low-maintenance pooch with a chamois cloth and she's ready to shine!
                        </p>
                        <h5>Short Dense Fur</h5>
                        <p>
                            If your dog has short, dense fur that's prone to matting, like that of a retriever, brushing once a week is fine. Use a slicker brush to remove tangles and catch dead hair with a bristle brush. Don't forget to comb her tail!
                        </p>
                        <h5>Long, Silky Coats</h5>
                        <p>
                            If your dog has a long, luxurious coat, such as that of a Yorkshire terrier, she'll need daily attention. Every day you'll need to remove tangles with a slicker brush. Next, brush her coat with a bristle brush. If you have a long-haired dog with a coat like a collie's or an Afghan hound's, follow the steps above, but also be sure to comb through the fur and trim the hair around the feet.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Long Hair That's Frequently Matted</h5>
                        <p>
                            For long-haired pooches, it's a good idea to set up a daily grooming routine to remove tangles and prevent mats. Gently tease out tangles with a slicker brush, and then brush your pet with a bristle brush. If matting is particularly dense, you may try clipping the hair, taking care not to come near the skin.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Shedding</h4>
                        <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="PIC_FOR_PROJECTS/shedding_dog_01.jpg" alt="pic" width="300px" height="300px">
                            <img src="PIC_FOR_PROJECTS/shedding_dog_02.jpg" alt="pic" width="300px" height="300px"> 
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            Although shedding old or damaged hair is a normal process for dogs, the amount and frequency of hair shed often depends upon their health, breed type and season. Many dogs develop thick coats in the winter that are then shed in the spring. Dogs who are always kept indoors, however, are prone to smaller fluctuations in coat thickness and tend to shed fairly evenly all year.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Steps to Minimize Shedding</h5>
                        <p>
                            While you cannot stop a healthy dog from normal shedding, you can reduce the amount of hair in your home by brushing your dog regularly. Ask your veterinarian or groomer to recommend a specific type of brush or comb that will work best for your dog’s hair type.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Excessive Hair Loss</h5>
                        <p>
                            Shedding is a normal process for pets. Excessive shedding can also be circumvented with proper nutrition. Quality pet-food manufacturers work hard to include the right amount of nutrients so that supplements are not needed, but pets with allergies or sensitivities might need to experiment with different brands to discover which food works best for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, excessive hair loss or bald patches may be due to one of the following:

                            Your dog’s skin is an indication of her overall health, so it’s important to keep it in prime shape. When a skin problem occurs, your dog may respond with excessive scratching, chewing and/or licking. A wide range of causes—including external parasites, infections, allergies, metabolic problems and stress, or a combination of these—may be to blame.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Odor</h5>
                        <p>
                            First check your pet's ears and teeth, as these are often the source of odor-causing bacteria in pets. Simply keeping your dog clean by routinely bathing him may be all that is needed to stop the smell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Perfumes for dogs are not likely to be of toxic concern to most pets when used according to label directions. However, dogs with dermal allergies can develop skin irritation and those with nasal allergies might be affected by the smell. If you wish to use pooch cologne, administer only as directed and consult a vet if the pet has any history of allergies.
                        </p>

                                Fleas. Bites and droppings from these pesky insects can irritate your dog’s skin, and some pets can have an allergic response to the saliva following a bite. Some dogs may also be sensitive to flea-treatment products; certain flea collars, for example, may cause redness and irritation around the neck.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ringworm. This highly contagious fungal infection can result in inflammation, scaly patches and hair loss. You’ll want to treat it immediately to avoid other pets and people in the household from becoming infected.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Seasonal or food allergies. Your dog’s scratching may be due to her sensitivity to allergens from common substances like pollen, weeds, dust, mites, trees, mold or grasses. Many dogs, like people, get dry, flaky skin in the winter. Many dogs develop allergies to common ingredients in dog foods, such as beef, chicken, wheat, corn or soy. Even fillers and colorings can be seen as foreign by your dog’s immune system and lead to itching and rashes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Skin infections. Dogs can develop irritating bacterial or yeast infections when the skin is damaged due to the presence of another skin disorder.

                            <li>
                                Sarcoptic mange. This skin disease caused by infection from the Sarcoptes scabei mite results in extreme itching and skin inflammation similar to an allergic response.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Grooming products. Certain shampoos and grooming products can irritate your dog’s skin. Be sure to only use grooming products that are meant for use on dogs.

                            <li>
                                Stress or boredom. A dog may lick her skin (especially her legs) excessively for many reasons. Some lick when not given adequate opportunity for activity or mental stimulation.

                            Regularly brushing your dog's teeth, along with a healthy diet and plenty of chew toys, can go a long way toward keeping her mouth healthy. Bacteria and plaque-forming foods can cause build-up on a dog's teeth. This can harden into tartar, potentially causing gingivitis, receding gums and tooth loss. Many pooches show signs of gum disease by the time they're four years old because they aren't provided with proper mouth care.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Give your dog regular home checks and you'll have a very contented pooch with a dazzling smile. We recommend brushing two to three times a week.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                First, you’ll want to get your pet used to the idea of having her teeth brushed. To do this, start by gently massaging her lips with your finger in a circular motion for 30 to 60 seconds once or twice a day for a few weeks before moving on to her teeth and gums.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After a few sessions or when your pooch seems comfortable, put a little bit of dog-formulated toothpaste on her lips to get her used to the taste.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Next, introduce a toothbrush designed especially for cats or dogs—it will be smaller than human toothbrushes and have softer bristles. Toothbrushes that you can wear over your finger are also available and allow you to give a nice massage to your pet's gums.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Place the brush or your gauze-wrapped finger at a 45-degree angle to the teeth and clean in small, circular motions. Work on one area of your dog's mouth at a time, lifting her lip as necessary. The side of the tooth that touches the cheek usually has the most tartar, and giving a final downward stroke can help to remove it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If your dog resists having the inner surfaces of her teeth cleaned, don't fight it—only a small amount of tartar accumulates there. Once you get the technique down, go for a brushing two or three times a week.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Choosing Toothpaste</h5>
                        <p>
                            Do not use human toothpaste, which can irritate a dog's stomach. Instead, ask your vet for toothpaste made especially for canines or make a paste out of baking soda and water.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Getting familiar with these common mouth problems will help you determine if it's time for your pet to see a vet:</h5>

                                Periodontal disease is a painful gum infection that can result in tooth loss and spread infection to the rest of the body. Signs are loose teeth, bad breath, tooth pain, sneezing and nasal discharge.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused mainly by accumulation of plaque, tartar and disease-producing bacteria above and below the gum line. Signs include bleeding, red, swollen gums and bad breath. It is reversible with regular teeth cleanings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Swollen gums develop when tartar builds up and food gets stuck between the teeth. Regularly brushing your dog's teeth at home and getting annual cleanings at the vet can prevent tartar and gingivitis.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Proliferating gum disease occurs when the gum grows over the teeth and must be treated to avoid gum infection. An inherited condition common to boxers and bull terriers, it can be treated with antibiotics.
                            </li>

                                Mouth tumors appear as lumps in the gums. Some are malignant and must be surgically removed.

                                Salivary cysts look like large, fluid-filled blisters under the tongue, but can also develop near the corners of the jaw. They require drainage, and the damaged saliva gland must be removed.

                                Canine distemper teeth can occur if a dog had distemper as a puppy. Adult teeth can appear looking eroded and can often decay. As damage is permanent, decayed teeth should be removed by a vet.

                        </ul>
                        <h5>Other Ways to Prevent Dental Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            Give your pooch treats that are specially formulated to keep canine teeth healthy, and ask your vet about a specially formulated dry food that can slow down the formation of plaque and tartar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chew toys are also a great way to satisfy your dog’s natural desire to chomp while making his or her teeth strong. Gnawing on a chew toy can help massage the gums and keep teeth clean by scraping away soft tartar, plus it also reduces your dog's overall stress level and prevents boredom. Ask your vet to recommend toxin-free rawhide, nylon and rubber chew toys.

                            Giving your pup regular home eye exams will help keep you alert to any tearing, cloudiness or inflammation that may indicate a health problem. First, face your dog in a brightly lit area and look into his eyes. They should be clear and bright, and the area around the eyeball should be white. The pupils should be equal in size and there shouldn’t be tearing, discharge or any crust in the corners of his eyes. With your thumb, gently roll down your dog’s lower eyelid and look at the lining. It should be pink, not red or white.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A gentle wipe with a damp cotton ball will help to keep your pet’s eyes gunk-free. Wipe outward from the inner corner of the eye and be careful not to touch his or her eyeball—you don’t want to scratch the cornea! If your pet constantly suffers from runny eyes and discharge, please see your veterinarian. Your pet may have an infection or plugged tear ducts.

                            The following are signs that something may be wrong with one or both of your dog’s eyes. Be sure to watch your pooch’s body language, too—pawing or rubbing his eye area may indicate possible problems. Call your veterinarian if your dog is experiencing any of these symptoms.

                        <h5>Preventing Eye Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            Long-haired breeds can get eye damage if their locks aren’t tamed. Carefully trim the hair around your dog’s eyes to keep his vision clear and prevent hairs from poking and scratching. Soaps and topical medications can be major irritants, so sure to protect your dog’s eyes before bathing him or applying ointments or flea-control formulas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s much safer to drive with the windows only partially down and your dog’s head inside the vehicle to prevent pain or long-last injury from road debris or an insect getting in her eyes. The wind can also dry out your dog’s eyes, possibly causing irritation and infection. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider doing a little research to find out if your dog’s breed is predisposed toward eye conditions, such as glaucoma or progressive retinal atrophy. Your pet should have his eyes checked on annual vet visits, but knowing about possible inherited problems will help you take important precautions.

                            Your dog’s regular grooming routine should include regular ear checks. This is especially important for dogs who produce excessive earwax or have a lot of inner-ear hair. Don’t clean your dog’s ears so frequently or deeply as to cause irritation, and take care to never insert anything into your dog’s ear canal—probing inside can cause trauma or infection!

                        <p>
                            Because a dog’s ear canals plunge downward and then horizontally from the ear opening, it is difficult for caught debris or water to be released, making canines especially susceptible to ear infections. Check your dog’s ears regularly for discharge, odor, swelling and other signs of infection. If your dog is showing any of the symptoms described below, see your veterinarian as soon as possible.

                        <h5>Ear Care For Dogs Who Swim</h5>
                        <p>
                            Frequent bathing or swimming can lead to ear irritation and infection. To prevent this from happening, place cotton in your dog’s ears before baths and be sure to dry his or her ears thoroughly after water sports and activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your dog is prone to ear infections, as your veterinarian to recommend an ear drying solution made for dogs to help evaporate any water trapped inside the ear canal. These ear washes, usually witch hazel-based, are available at better pet supply stores.

                        <h5>Signs Of Ear Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            Because of the twisty, curvy design a dog’s inner ears, it’s easy for parasites, bacteria and yeast to hide in them and infections can often arise as a result of this trapped debris. Dogs with allergies are particularly vulnerable to complications, as are those with floppy ears, like Cocker spaniels, Basset Hounds and Poodles. Brown or black ear wax—and dry, dark wax resembling coffee grounds—are classic indicators of microscopic ear mites. Only your vet can tell for sure, so please don’t delay bringing your pooch in for a checkup.

                        <p>
                            As a rule of thumb, a dog’s nails should be trimmed when they just about touch the ground when he or she walks. If your pet’s nails are clicking or getting snagged on the floor, it’s time for a trim. For leisurely living dogs, this might mean weekly pedicures, while urban pooches who stalk rough city sidewalks can go longer between clippings.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Finding Nail Clippers For Your Dog</h5>
                        <p>
                            There are two basic styles of nail clippers for dogs: a scissors type and a guillotine type. They both work equally well, so choose the design that you’re most comfortable with. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your dog finds both kinds of clippers intolerable, an alternative tool is a nail grinder, an electric tool that sands nails down. These offer great control, but take longer than clippers and some people (and dogs) find the sounds and vibrations they produce unpleasant. Ask your veterinarian or groomer for advice about what types of nail trimmers are best for your dog and how to use them properly.

                        <p>
                            Some dogs don’t like to have their feet touched, so it’s always a good idea to get your dog used to it before you attempt to clip his nails—ideally, this should start when he’s a pup. Rub your hand up and down the leg and then gently press each individual toe, and be sure to give her lots of praise and treats! Within a week or two of daily foot massage, your dog should feel more comfortable with a nail trim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before beginning a pup pedicure, tire your dog out with some vigorous exercise and enlist an assistant to help you hold her down.

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Begin by spreading each of your dog's feet to inspect for dirt and debris.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Take your dog’s toe and hold it firmly, but gently. Hold your trimmer so that you’re cutting the nail from top to bottom at a slight angle, not side to side, and insert a very small length of nail through the trimmer’s opening to cut off the tip of each nail. Don’t trim at a blunt angle as to maintain the existing curvature of the nail.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cut a little bit of nail with each pass until you can see the beginning of a circle—still nail-colored—appear on the cut surface. The circle indicates that you are nearing the quick, a vein that runs into the nail, so it’s time to stop that nail and move on to the next.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If your dog has black nails, however, the quick will not be as easily discernible, so be extra careful. If you do accidentally cut into the quick, it may bleed, in which case you can apply some styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the nails have been cut, use an emery board to smooth any rough edges.

                        <p>
                            If you do hit the quick, your dog will probably yelp and might even struggle. This is a good time to end the session—but not before applying styptic powder or corn starch to the bleeding nail tip. Apply a little bit of pressure as you press the powder into the wound to make sure it sticks. If bleeding continues for more than a few minutes, please alert your veterinarian, who can check your dog for clotting disorders.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Helping Fearful Dogs</h5>
                        <p>
                            Some dogs show fearful or aggressive behavior when faced with nail trimming. Watch carefully for signs of distress such as panting, drooling, trembling, whining, freezing, cowering, tail-tucking, growling, snarling or snapping. Even with the most patient and gradual of introductions, there are dogs who seem unable to get over their terror.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your dog falls into this category, do not force him to submit. See if his veterinarian or a professional groomer has better luck getting the job done—if not, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB) or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) to work on the underlying issues at hand.

                            The pads on the bottom of your pups feet provide extra cushioning to help protect bones and joints from shock, provide insulation against extreme weather, aid walking on rough ground and protect tissue deep within the paw. It’s important to check your pet’s feet regularly to make sure they’re free of wounds, infections or foreign objects that can become lodged. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To keep them in tip-top shape, look for foxtails, pebbles, small bits of broken glass and other debris. Remove any splinters or debris gently with tweezers. Then, comb and trim the hair between the toes to be even with the pads to avoid painful matting.  
                        </p>
                        <h5>Using Moisturizer</h5>
                        <p>
                            If your dog’s pads have become cracked and dry, ask your veterinarian for a good pad moisturizer and use as directed. Avoid human hand moisturizers, which can soften the pads and lead to injury. A paw message will relax your dog and promote better circulation. Start by rubbing between the pads on the bottom of the paw, and then rub between each toe.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Treating Wounds</h5>
                        <p>
                            It’s not unusual for dogs to suffer cuts or wounds from accidently stepping on glass, debris or other objects. Wounds that are smaller than a half inch in diameter can be cleaned with an antibacterial wash and wrapped with a light bandage. For deeper paw cuts, see your veterinarian for treatment.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Winter And Summer Paw Care</h5>
                        <p>
                            As with humans, your dog’s paws will require different types of care depending on the season. The bitter cold of winter can cause chapping and cracking in your dog’s paws. Rock salt and chemical ice melters can cause sores, infection and blistering, and toxic chemicals can also be ingested by your dog when he licks his paws. Beat these wintertime blues by washing your dog’s paws in warm water after outdoor walks to rinse away salt and chemicals. You may wish to apply Vaseline, a great salt barrier, to your pet’s pads before each walk—or make sure your dog wears doggie booties. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the summer, it’s important to remember your dog’s paws feel heat extremes. Just imagine stepping barefoot onto hot pavement—ouch! To prevent burns and blisters, avoid walking your dog on hot pavement or sand. Watch for blisters, loose flaps of skin and red, ulcerated patches on your pet’s pads. For minor burns, apply antibacterial wash to the paw and cover with a loose bandage. For serious burns, please visit your vet immediately. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Peventing Paw Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            When starting a new exercise program with your dog, start off slow. Paws may become sensitive, chaffed or cracked, particularly when starting your dog out on hikes or runs. Be sure to keep your home and yard clear of pointy bits and pieces, and avoid hazards such as broken glass and other debris when walking your dog. Always keep this simple tip in mind—if you wouldn’t like to walk barefoot on it, neither will your dog!

                <h3>Handling</h3>
                <p>
                    To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Housing</h3>
                <p>
                    Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be spending a lot of time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter when it's cold. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Licensing And Identification</h3>
                <p>
                    Follow your community’s licensing regulations. Be sure to attach the license to your dog’s collar. This, along with an ID tag and implanted microchip or tattoo, can help secure your dog’s return should she become lost.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Medicines And Poisons</h3>
                <p>
                    Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian

                <h3>Fleas And Ticks</h3>
                <p>
                    Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options

                    Fleas and ticks are two of the most frequent pet care concerns in America. While prevention is the best defense against these parasites, it’s important to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of fleas and ticks so you can help your pets if necessary. Read on for more information. 
                </p>
                <h4>Fleas</h4>
                <p>
                    Fleas are the most common external parasite to plague companion animals. They are wingless insects that feed on blood, can jump up to two feet high and are persistent in the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fleas can live for as few as 13 days or as long as 12 months—and during that time, can produce millions of offspring. Though there are many species of fleas, the one that most often affects both dogs and cats in North America is the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis.
                </p>
                <h5>Symptoms Of Fleas On Dogs</h5>
                <p>
                    Fleas are most commonly noticed on a dog’s abdomen, the base of the tail and the head. Common symptoms of fleas on dogs include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dropping or "flea dirt" in a dog's coat (small dark "grains of sand")

                </ul>
                <h5>Symptoms Of Fleas On Cats</h5>
                <p>
                    If you see your cat scratching often and persistently, invest in a fine tooth comb and run it through her fur, paying special attention to the neck and the base of the tail. If you see small, fast-moving brown shapes about the size of a pinhead in her fur, your cat has fleas. Other symptoms: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Droppings of “flea dirt” in a cat’s fur (small dark "grains of sand")

                </ul>
                <h5>Causes Of Fleas</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fleas are easily brought in from the outdoors
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fleas thrive in warm, humid climates at temperatures of 65 to 80 degrees. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adult fleas spend most of their lives on the animal, laying eggs in the fur. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These eggs drop out onto rugs, upholstery, bedding and furniture; the new adult fleas will, in turn, find their living host (either human or animal).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Flea Complications</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fleas can consume 15 times their own body weight in blood, which can cause anemia or a significant amount of blood loss over time 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is especially problematic in young puppies or kittens, where an inadequate number of red blood cells can be life-threatening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some pets have heightened sensitive to the saliva of fleas, which can cause an allergic reaction known as flea allergy dermatitis. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Flea Treatment</h5>
                <p>
                    Consult your veterinarian if you suspect your pet has fleas. It is important that all of your pets are treated for fleas, including indoor and outdoor cats, and that the environment is treated as well. Once your veterinarian confirms the diagnosis, a treatment plan may include the following: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Topical or oral treatment or the use of shampoos, sprays and powders on the pet. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thorough cleaning of your house, including rugs, bedding and upholstery. Severe cases may require using a spray or a fogger, which requires temporary evacuation of the home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is very important not to use products on your cat that are intended for dogs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lawn treatments may also be needed if your pet keeps getting re-infected every time it goes outside.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Flea Prevention</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use a flea comb on your pet and wash his bedding once a week.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the outside of your house free of organic debris, such as rake clippings and leaves, and remember that fleas like to hide in dark, moist, shady areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are many preventative flea control products available, both as prescription and over-the-counter formulas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Ticks</h4>
                <p>
                    Ticks are parasites that feed on the blood of unlucky host animals, such as cats and dogs. Like mites and spiders, ticks are arachnids. Although their presence may not even be noticed by the host, ticks can transmit many diseases through their bite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tick species and disease transmission tend to vary based on where you live, so check with your vet about what is common in your area. 
                </p>
                <h5>Tick Transmission</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most species of ticks require blood meals from a host to survive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ticks bury their head into a host's skin when they bite and then gorge themselves on blood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ticks tend to be most active in late spring and summer and live in tall brush or grass, where they can attach to dogs and outdoor cats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ticks can be transferred from pets coming into the household from outdoors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ticks prefer to attach close to the head, neck, ears and feet, but can be found anywhere on your pet’s body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ticks are particularly prominent in warm climates and certain wooded areas of the Northeast.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>How Do I know if My Pet Has Ticks?</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most ticks are visible to the naked eye. Ticks are often the size of a pinhead before they bite, and not noticed until they swell with blood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While these parasites rarely cause obvious discomfort, it is a good idea to check your pet regularly if you live in an area where ticks are prevalent, especially if he spends a lot of time outside. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Run your hands carefully over your pet every time he comes inside, and especially check inside and around the ears, head and feet.

                        <b>Cytauxzoonosis</b> <br>
                        <p>
                            Cytauxzoonosis is a lethal infection caused by tick bites.This blood parasite is common in the South and is carried by bobcats.Ticks who feed on bobcats may transmit the infection to domestic cats, for whom the disease is fatal.Clinical signs of infection include: high fever, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, jaundice, coma and death.The infection progresses rapidly—in a matter of weeks—and there is no known cure, though several studies have proved successful in managing certain strains of the disease.

                <h3>Spaying And Neutering</h3>
                <p>
                    Female dogs should be spayed and male dogs neutered by six months of age. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By spaying or neutering your pet, you’ll help control the pet homelessness crisis, which results in millions of healthy dogs and cats being euthanized in the United States each year simply because there aren’t enough homes to go around. There are also medical and behavioral benefits to spaying (female pets) and neutering (male pets) your animals 
                </p>
                <h5>Here are some of the medical  and behavioral benefits:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your female pet will live a longer, healthier life. Spaying helps prevent uterine infections and breast tumors, which are malignant or cancerous in about 50 percent of dogs and 90 percent of cats. Spaying your pet before her first heat offers the best protection from these diseases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Neutering your male companion prevents testicular cancer and some prostate problems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your spayed female pet won't go into heat. While cycles can vary, female felines usually go into heat four to five days every three weeks during breeding season. In an effort to advertise for mates, they'll yowl and urinate more frequently—sometimes all over the house!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your male dog will be less likely to roam away from home. An intact male will do just about anything to find a mate, including finding creative ways escape from the house. Once he's free to roam, he risks injury in traffic and fights with other male animals. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your neutered male may be better behaved. Unneutered dogs and cats are more likely to mark their territory by spraying strong-smelling urine all over the house. Your dog might be less likely to mount other dogs, people and inanimate objects after he’s neutered. Some aggression problems may be avoided by early neutering. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Spaying/neutering your pets is also highly cost-effective. The cost of your pet's spay/neuter surgery is far less than the cost of having and caring for a litter.
                </p>
                <h5>Debunking Spay/Neuter Myths and Misconceptions</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spaying or neutering will not cause your pet to become overweight. Lack of exercise and overfeeding will cause your pet to pack on the extra pounds—not neutering. Your pet will remain fit and trim as long as you continue to provide exercise and monitor her food intake.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Neutering is not a quick fix for all behavior problems. Although neutering your pet often reduces undesirable behaviors caused by a higher level of testosterone, there’s no guarantee that your dog’s behavior will change after he’s neutered. Although the surgery will reduce the amount of testosterone in your dog’s system, it won’t eliminate the hormone completely. Neutering will also not reduce behaviors that your pet has learned or that have become habitual. The effects of neutering are largely dependent on your dog’s individual personality, physiology and history.

                <h5>When To Spray or Neuter Your Pet</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>For Dogs:</b>While the traditional age for neutering is six to nine months, puppies as young as eight weeks old can be neutered as long as they’re healthy. Dogs can be neutered as adults as well, although there’s a slightly higher risk of post-operative complications in older dogs, dogs that are overweight or dogs that have health problems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>For Cats:</b>It is generally considered safe for kittens as young as eight weeks old to be spayed or neutered. In animal shelters, surgery is often performed at this time so that kittens can be sterilized prior to adoption. In an effort to avoid the start of urine spraying and eliminate the chance for pregnancy, it’s advisable to schedule the surgery before your own cat reaches five months of age. It’s possible to spay a female cat while she’s in heat.

                <h3>Vaccinations</h3>
                <p>
                    Your dog may benefit from receiving a number of vaccinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vaccines help prevent many illnesses that affect pets. Vaccinating your pet has long been considered one of the easiest ways to help him live a long, healthy life. Not only are there different vaccines for different diseases, there are different types and combinations of vaccines. Vaccination is a procedure that has risks and benefits that must be weighed for every pet relative to his lifestyle and health. Your veterinarian can determine a vaccination regime that will provide the safest and best protection for your individual animal.
                </p>
                <h4>Understanding Vaccines</h4>
                <p>
                    Vaccines help prepare the body's immune system to fight the invasion of disease-causing organisms. Vaccines contain antigens, which look like the disease-causing organism to the immune system but don't actually cause disease. When the vaccine is introduced to the body, the immune system is mildly stimulated. If a pet is ever exposed to the real disease, his immune system is now prepared to recognize and fight it off entirely or reduce the severity of the illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vaccines are very important to managing the health of your pet. That said, not every pet needs to be vaccinated against every disease. It is very important to discuss with your veterinarian a vaccination protocol that’s right for your pet. Factors that should be examined include age, medical history, environment, travel habits and lifestyle. Most vets highly recommend administering core vaccines to healthy pets. 
                </p>
                <h4>Risk Associated With Vaccination</h4>
                <p>
                    Immunizations should mildly stimulate the animal’s immune system in order to create protection from specific infectious diseases. This stimulation can create mild symptoms, ranging from soreness at the injection site to fever and allergic reactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are other, less common side effects like injection site tumors and immune disease associated with vaccination. That said, it is important to realize that vaccines have saved countless lives, and play a vital role in the battle against infectious diseases. As with any medical procedure, there is a small chance of side effects. In most cases, the risks are much smaller than the risks of disease itself. But it is important to talk to your veterinarian about your pet’s medical history before he is vaccinated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most pets show no ill effect from vaccination. Vaccine reactions may be minor and short-lived or require immediate care from a veterinarian. Clinical signs include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is best to schedule your pet’s appointment so that you can monitor him for any side effects following administration of the vaccine. If you suspect your pet is having a reaction to a vaccine, call your veterinarian immediately.
